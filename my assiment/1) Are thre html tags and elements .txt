20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML? 
Ans.=> Logical Tags:-
      -Logical tags refer to the semantic elements in HTML that are used to define the structure and meaning of content. 
      -These elements convey the purpose or role of the content, making it more accessible to both humans and machines. 
      -Logical tags are designed to provide information about the content rather than its appearance.

     -Examples of logical tags in HTML5 include:- <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <h1> to <h6>,
                                                  <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, and many more. 
     -These tags help structure the content and provide semantic information about the sections, headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and other elements.
     
    => Physical Tags:-
      -The term "physical tags" is less commonly used, but it could refer to the presentational or formatting elements in HTML. 
      -These elements are used to define the appearance or visual presentation of content, rather than its meaning or structure.

      -In earlier versions of HTML, there were various physical tags, such as <b>, <i>, <u>, <font>, <strike>, and <center>, among others. 
      -These tags directly influenced the appearance of the text or elements, indicating bold, italic, underlined text, font properties, strikethrough, or center alignment.
